# Training The Beagle

A project about learning how to use the Beaglebone Black, by Jonas Hummel and Graham Booth.

The aim of this repo is to document our work using the Beaglebone for combined audio and physical computing projects, and to make this work reusable as lessons or tutorials for others. All the projects contained here are 

Debian Linux
Jack
SuperCollider
Adafruit BBIO library
Open Sound Control

## Topic List

Here are a list of topics for possible future sessions:

- How to run sounds on top of what the beagle is running at startup
- Battery power: finding good solutions for creating a mobile device
- Wifi communication (dongles)
- Approaches to automatic startup (Graham's init script approach v Fredrik's crontab approach)
- Revisiting Chinese Whispers Networking classes to create adhoc networks of several beagles

## Schedule:

- Skype again Wed May 28th (possibly, if Jonas' solves Batch error)
- Skype again Mon June 2nd
- Graham leaves on July 6th, how many sessions do we want to do before then, and what can we realistically cover?

Jonas develops another beagle board there to be used for a mobile networking device, running supercollider, audioprocessing, networking to connect to a central "Republic-like" Server. 
With a tangible interface (using skin conductance to close connections).
