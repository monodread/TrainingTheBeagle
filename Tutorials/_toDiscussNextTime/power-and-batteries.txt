TUTORIAL: Power and Batteries

- this document deals with the four methods of powering the beaglebone, these being: external PSU, power over USB, power over ethernet and battery power

* 1. Using an External Power Supply
- beaglebone uses a 5v 2A
- advisable as provides enough amps

* 2. Power Over USB
- is possible but not advisable as USB doesn't typically provide enough amps to reliably read and write to the SD card reader

* 3. Power Over Ethernet
- in some projects which use ethernet anyway, PoE would help in reducing cabling/complexity
- PoE is specified by IEEE 802.3-2005
- basic explanation:
"Power over Ethernet or PoE describes any of several standardized or ad-hoc systems which pass electrical power along with data on Ethernet cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both data connection and electrical power to devices such as wireless access points or IP cameras. Unlike standards such as Universal Serial Bus which also power devices over the data cables, PoE allows long cable lengths. Power may be carried on the same conductors as the data, or it may be carried on dedicated conductors in the same cable."

- more details here: http://www.connect802.com/ethernet.htm
- use with Arduino here: http://www.freetronics.com/pages/power-over-ethernet-for-arduino

- There are two basic options for providing the power:

** 1. PoE enabled switch
- switch acts as a power source
- costs at least £25

** 2. Midspan
- power injector is injected by a device inserted between the switch and the beagle
- midspans seem to make no sense if a separate power adapter is needed for each one (is this the case?)
- midspans cost?
- a cheap but dodgy solution is to hack up and power an ethernet cable

* 4. Battery Power

** Overview

- beaglebone uses the TPS65217C for power management
- link to datasheet:
- can be used to run from and to charge a battery
- a common way to power the beaglebone is via a single cell lion or lipo battery (typically 3.7v)
- this will power the beagle itself, but not the USB port
- the problem is that the USB host port design assumes that 5V is being supplied to the board…
- …but there is nothing there to generate 5V from the battery input
- battery capes are available, may be useful to study their design e.g. : http://circuitco.com/support/index.php?title=BeagleBone_Battery
- but does it provide power to the USB host port?
- one thread suggests: "A good solution to this is to use an external battery pack designed for Smartphones. I use www.powerocks.com - These charge from a standard USB charger (5v) and also produce 5v output on USB sockets. So just plug the Beaglebone into the battery pack using the supplied USB cable. This will power the Beaglebone USB host socket enabling the WiFi dongle. However I do not know if the USB input on the Beaglebone limits current draw to 500mA - If so, you may need to make a special cable to feed the power into the dedicated power socket instead. WiFi dongles are quite power hungry."

AIM: to power the beagle and its USB port via battery, in a compact form

Seems there are two ways to go with battery power in general:
1. via TPS65217C 4 pins
2. via barrel jack

Option 1 won't power the USB port, but the TPS65217C can do fancy things like recharging the battery if mains power is supplied

Option 2 will power the USB port but with non automatic recharge possibilities

TI TPS65217C handles power management and is programmable. The IC also contains built-in battery charging capability.

BBB can be run from 3.7V
but for USB we need to
- use one cell and step-up to 5V
or
- run dual cells and step-down to 5V

If the main supply gets disconnected, the battery immediately takes over.

Lithium Ion (Li-Ion)
Lithium Polymer (Li-Po)
preferably w/ built-in protection circuit. 

1400mah lasts 2h50m / charges in about 2 hours

tp5 bat - battery connection point
tp6 sense - battery voltage sense input
tp7 ts - temp sense input
tp8 gnd - system ground

Capes:
These capes support powering the USB port

Power Banks
Power Banks use typically use a number of 3.7v lipo 18650 batteries wired in together.
I think:
wiring in series increase voltage
wiring in parallel increases capacity

The built in power bank circuitry does the useful job of giving us a 5v 2A output (for ipads) which is perfect for the beagle.

Interesting power banks on Taobao:

DIY:
- with this one you can buy the power bank parts, which would be good for making a diy battery shield (see images)
http://a.m.taobao.com/i35540106206.htm?ttid=212200@taobao_android_4.2.2

Single battery:
- ML102
- 2014 version has a micro USB input for charging
- standard USB output for supplying power
- description suggests it could supply 1200mA output (enough for beagle amd usb?)
http://a.m.taobao.com/i36546498972.htm?ttid=212200@taobao_android_4.2.2

Dual battery:
- small and solid with 2A output
- how good is the protection circuit?
http://a.m.taobao.com/i20085144001.htm?ttid=212200@taobao_android_4.2.2

triple battery:
- good size match for beaglebone:
- beagle is 86.40×53.3mm
- this bank is 75x75x22mm
74x80

removable battery cover:

multiple voltages (not just 5v):
http://a.m.taobao.com/i13062921497.htm?ttid=212200@taobao_android_4.2.2

step down from using two 3.7 batteries?

# Once we have 5v, do we connect to tp5-8 or to 5v jack in?

seems jack-in is the way to go
need to make up a barrel connector

report that 5V via tp5 does not work with a thermistor soldered.l between tp7 and tp8:

usb tutorial below successfully powers the BBB from battery via the 5v barrel jack input. Other users report stability problems this way...

Tutorial with USB here (not compact but works):
http://insigntech.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/power-bbb-on-car-battery-12vdc/
a 12v battery is stepped down to 5v, which powers both the beagle (5v jack in) and a powered usb hub. The hub runs from the beagles usb port and hosts two usb devices
