- this document covers the basics of using SuperCollider from the command line on a beaglebone black
- it presumes you are running Debian, with functioning soundcard, and SuperCollider and jackd/alsa are correctly installed

- simple three-line example on starting SuperCollider from Fredrik: https://github.com/redFrik/udk10-Embedded_Systems/tree/master/udk131205#--starting-supercollider

* Extensions

- custom classes can be used by placing .sc files in the SuperCollider extension folder(s)
- there are two types of extension folder in SuperCollider, user extensions (user-specific) and system extensions (system-wide)
- user extensions is found at: /home/debian/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
- system extensions is found at: /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
- this can also be queried from sclang itself, as follows:
- firstly, start sclang from the command line:
$ sclang
- then from the sclang command prompt, type:
Platform.userExtensionDir
- or
Platform.systemExtensionDir

* Troubleshooting

- a list of known bugs and issues when using sclang

** "ERROR: No GUI scheme active" when running sclang

- the following error occurs when running sclang, but is not fatal and can be ignored
