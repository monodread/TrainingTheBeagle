* TUTORIAL: Internet Access

- TO BE WRITTEN
- will deal with how to access the internet over ethernet from a beaglebone (to perform software updates etc)
- this was a major problem in CW/RebDev
- will document two approaches which I have tried:
- 1. beagle -> wireless router via ethernet
- 2. beagle -> wireless router via wifi dongle
