TUTORIAL: Audio Hardware

- this document covers interfacing with different audio hardware from Debian on the Beaglebone Black
- this currently limited to two approaches: a low-cost USB sound card and audio over HDMI

* USB Thumbdrive Soundcard

\TODO/ overview of jackd and alsa settings here

* HDMI

- apparently HDMI audio output is the standard, but where does it come out?
- noticed that HDMI audio worked in Debian accidentally when connecting my pico projector
- this could be an interesting way to not need USB power in future

Also, apparently multi channel audio is possible:

This would seem to suggest itâ€™s possible: http://www.elinux.org/BeagleBone_Black_Capes
Though others think not:
One thing worth noting is that the BBB does not actually support audio out over the mHDMI yet (though it is said to be coming in a near-term release).
