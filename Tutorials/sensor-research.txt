* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Sensor

...about power: 
The HC-SR04 is a 5V device, and will not operate at any less than that. As the beaglebone, along with every other ARM Cortex based system, has a maximum voltage of 3.3V, we have to protect the beaglebone from the sonar.  Essentially all I did for this was connect an NPN transistor between one of the beaglebone’s IO pins and ground.  This is fine considering that each of the IO lines on the beaglebone has a configurable pullup or pulldown resistor, we just have to note that the signal is now inverted.  The base of the transistor is connected through a 220 ohm resistor to the echo line of the sonar.  From experimenting, turns out 3.3V is enough to cause the sonar to trigger, so we can hook one of the beaglebone’s IO lines right up to the trigger pin.

...about general operation:
The operation of the HC-SR04 sonar is fairly straight forward.  One sends a trigger pulse of at least 10 microseconds.  The device then waits for the echo line to activate (in our inverted case, high to low transition) and measures the time from there until it deactivates (low to high in our case).  This time is the round trip flight time of the sonar pulse.  Divide this number by 58, and you have the distance to target in centimeters.
