# TODO
- check that time.clock will actually work as an approach for measuring elapsed time

# Requirements:
# This capacitive sensing method requires two microcontroller pins (send pin, receive pin)
# with a high value resistor between them (1M is a starting point)
# a small capacitor (20-40 pf) from the receive pin (the sensor is connected to this pin)
# to ground will result in more stable readings. Sensor is any wire or conductive foil
# on the receive pin.
