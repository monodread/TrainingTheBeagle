* TUTORIAL: Github Basics

- sidechained created a master repo
- monodread forked it on the github website (fork button)
- monodread cloned his fork of it to a local directory:
$ git clone ahttps://github.com/monodread/TrainingTheBeagle.git
- monodread added an upstream of the original project master:
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/monodread/TrainingTheBeagle.git
- sidechained created a new file in TrainingTheBeagle/Tutorials and pushed it
$ touch test
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "added test"
$ git push
- monodread fetched the upstream change:
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
- vim editor comes up, press I
$ git commit -m "merged"
- sidechained created another new file in TrainingTheBeagle/Tutorials and pushed it
$ touch test2
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "added test2"
$ git push
- monodread pulled in the changes (instead of merging, this time)
$ git pull
- sidechained and monodread's repo's are now identical

To write the file you're editing, enter w. (So, you'll have :w.) That will write the file to the existing filename. If you don't have a filename or want to write out to a different filename, use :w filename.
