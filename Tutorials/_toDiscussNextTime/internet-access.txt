- TO BE WRITTEN

* TUTORIAL: Internet Access

- will deal with how to access the internet over ethernet from a beaglebone (to perform software updates etc)
- this was a major problem in CW/RebDev
- will document two approaches which I have tried:

* beagle -> wireless router via ethernet

* beagle -> wireless router via wifi dongle

*** snippets from google doc:
- FIXED: need to share laptop internet connection with BeagleBoard
- 1. connect ethernet cable from macbook to BeagleBoard
2. in System Preferences -> Sharing enable Internet Sharing (WIFI to Ethernet))

-  now that mac has a manual IP, a) internet connection sharing doesn’t work and b) can’t ssh in using ethernet over USB. Workaround for now is to use the old /etc/network/interfaces file and plug USB keyboard if need to install things over the internet, then switch back to the new /etc/network/interfaces file to allow ssh access again (phew!)
