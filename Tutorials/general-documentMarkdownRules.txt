## Rules for Markdown in this Project

Some conventions I think we should follow when using markdown:

* we use ## for the document title (not #)
'# is too big, but # and ## both include a big line break below them'
* for first sub heading use '###', other headings use '####'
#### Sample Heading
* we use *italics* to represents notes or questions to ourselves
* we use a **bold** __TODO__ to represent elements of tutorials that still need to be completed

* *when marking Comments in a code block we use SC Syntax ('//') -> or rather Terminal Syntax ('#') ?*

#### More Basic Formatting Syntax 
**Valuable things to know & use:**
*this info is compiled from: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown and https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics*

* make text bold or italic:
*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
(Both bold and italic can use either a * or an _ around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed. 
In a word with several underscores, it won't work properly! e.g. perform_complicated_task)

* striketrough text: 
use double '~'. My ~~error~~

* Bullet points / lists 
'*' makes bullet points and starts a list (you can use hypens '-' as well)

* CODE formatting:
1. Enclosing in single 's is good for marking up single lines of code e.g.
'$ sudo python thisismycode.py '

2. enclosing in triple ```'s is good for marking up code blocks e.g.
'''
// my amazing sc patch
s.boot
s.quit
'''

3. Syntax Colorization: 
use ''' [nameOfLanguage] â€¦

* Making Paragraphs: 
Leaving two or spaces at the end of a line forces a carriage return/end of paragraph

* many singles lines containing many ----'s or ===='s create a line break
-----------------------

* LINKS:
[thisLink] followed by (http://www.link.com) creates a hyperlink that hides the URL under "thislink"
[Jonas' archive] (http://jonashummel.de)

* ADDITIONALS:
-> markdown creates nice links next to each heading the document (hover over left of each section heading to see!)

* Insert an Image: 

* Insert a Table:

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
