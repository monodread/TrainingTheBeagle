- user extensions is found at: /home/debian/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
- system extensions is found at: /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
- this can also be queried from sclang itself, as follows:
- firstly, start sclang from the command line:
$ sclang
- then from the sclang command prompt, type:
Platform.userExtensionDir
- or
Platform.systemExtensionDir
