TUTORIAL: Networking

- this document includes tutorials on basic networking and troubleshooting

* 1. Tutorials

** Giving the Beaglebone a Static IP

- this section assumes by default that you are working with ethernet
- guide here: http://elinux.org/RPi_Setting_up_a_static_IP_in_Debian
- and here: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/change-ubuntu-server-from-dhcp-to-a-static-ip-address/

- on Debian, DHCP is enabled by default
- using DHCP is often an issue
- to change this we need to edit /etc/network/interfaces
- firstly, log in
$ ssh debian@192.168.1.3
- now make a backup of the interfaces file (in case of emergency)
$ sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.bak
- edit the original version
$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
- replace the following...
iface eth0 inet dhcp
- with… (example for IP of 192.168.1.3)

iface eth0 inet static
       address 192.168.1.3
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       network 192.168.1.0
       broadcast 192.168.1.255
       gateway 192.168.1.1

- restart networking
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking reload

** Working with DHCP

- is there an easy way work with the beagle over DHCP and know what IP it has been allocated?
- according to http://www.armhf.com/index.php/getting-started-with-ubuntu-img-file/ Wheezy runs a DHCP server by default
- suggestion is: Try pinging it by name: "debian-armhf" for the debian images and "ubuntu-armhf" for the ubuntu images. It is setup for DHCP, so whatever your network handed out. You could mount partition 2 of the SD card and check the logs or edit the /etc/network/interfaces file to have a static IP address:

** Working over USB

** Using beaglebone.local

- in what cases can this approach be used instead?
- only when connected over USB?

** Enabling a WIFI Dongle

- It is recommended to use a WIFI dongle that is based on the RALINK 5370 chipset
- e.g. http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Mini-150-Mbps-USB-Nano-802-11n-Wireless-Wifi-Network-LAN-Card-Adapter-EDUP-EP-N8531/409201_840839946.html

- this requires different settings in the /etc/interfaces file
- NOTE FROM GRAHAM: i started experimenting with this, will find the docs and add here

# wireless network interface
#auto wlan0
#iface wlan0 inet dhcp
#   wpa-ssid "my_wifi_name"
#   wpa-psk  "my_wifi_pass"

* 2. Troubleshooting

- a list of common network problems and how to resolve them

** How to make sure the ethernet adapter appears as eth0
- in some cases, it is possible for the ethernet adapter to appear as eth1, not eth0 which can cause a lot of head bashing
- e.g. this can happen when sharing a single SD card with multiple BeagleBones
- for more info see http://eewiki.net/display/linuxonarm/BeagleBone+Black#BeagleBoneBlack-Networking

- to always enable the Ethernet interface as eth0, do the following:
$ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
- add the following lines
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
# BeagleBone: net device ()
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
